## Packages
framer-motion | Animations for the terminal and UI elements
date-fns | Formatting timestamps in logs
lucide-react | Icons for the interface (already in base, but listing for completeness)

## Notes
- Polling is required for /api/bot/status and /api/logs (every 2s recommended)
- The UI uses a "Cyberpunk/Hacker" aesthetic with heavy use of monospace fonts and neon colors
